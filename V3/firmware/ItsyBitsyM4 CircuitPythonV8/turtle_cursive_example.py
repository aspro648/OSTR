'''
Place turtle in center of paper facing east.

Hershey fonts were developed in the 1960s for rendering text on cathode ray tube displays.
They use a rather cryptic method of encoding coordinate pairs using ascii characters.
Since the turtle output is vector (direction and distance), Hershey font codes can be
converted to turtle code on the fly, giving us access to cursive turtle writing!

use either:
    from hersey_font import cursive as glyphs
    from hersey_font import simple as glyphs
