Have a look at the [28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor part](../28BYJ-48-motor/) also.

## NOTES

* The JST connector pins are incorrectly marked as **female** on purpose, as a trick to *help* Fritzing connect the 28BYJ-48 Unipolar Stepper Motor to it more *naturally* (the same trick is applied to the motor itself).

* Used some of [the fritzing tools by @Vanepp](https://github.com/vanepp): go check them.
