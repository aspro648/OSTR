# Modded Powerbank-DIY 5V
A fritzing part of a Powerbank-DIY (do it yourself) modded with dupont cables as refected in [this guide (Spanish)](https://www.roboteach.es/modificacion-power-bank/). 5V output with -normally- nice security protections like anti-short-circuit, over-charge and over-discharge.
